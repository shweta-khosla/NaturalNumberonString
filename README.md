# NaturalNumberonString
Project 2
Project Summary:
Java.lang must be used to implement a kernel class for the new type NaturalNumber as part of the NaturalNumber on String project.The underlying representation is a string. The project's main goal is to finish and test kernel functions while following the abstraction function and representation constant defined by the given Java class.
Implementation:
NaturalNumber3 needs to implement the following kernel methods in the src folder:
multiplyBy10(int k): This function ensures that the representation constant is maintained by multiplying the number by 10 and adding k.
divideBy10() produces an integer after removing the final digit.
isZero(): Verifies if the value is zero.
Testing:
Within the test folder, testing needs to be completed in NaturalNumber3Test and NaturalNumberTest, which includes:
Use the constructorTest and constructorRef methods to implement constructor tests.
Kernel Method Tests: Create an organised test strategy for every kernel method.
Extended Assessment: Create tests for common methods such as transferFrom, clean, and newInstance.
